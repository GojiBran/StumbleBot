The StumbleChat Bot is a UserScript written in JavaScript designed to enhance the user experience on StumbleChat, a web-based chat platform, by adding additional functionality for handling specific chat messages and enabling media playback within the chat room.

The script modifies the behavior of WebSocket communication to intercept and manipulate messages. It establishes a WebSocket connection with the chat server and overrides the send method to intercept outgoing messages.
